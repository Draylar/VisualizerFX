# VisualizerFX
Proof of concept music visualizer, built in JavaFX.

Built to show how music can be visualized through FFT-- uses JavaFX and Minim. To run, you currently have to change the 'your_music_path_here' constructor argument in Main until further notice. No smoothing is done to the FFT which is why it looks so bad, but it still works!

UI will be improved in the future.
